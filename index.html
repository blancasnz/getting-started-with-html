<h1>Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>

<h3>The Web</h3>
<p>The basics of the web include <em>The Web, HTML, URLS,
  HTTP, </em> and <em>Web Applications.</em></p>

 <p>Major pieces of the web include <em>You, the Browser,
  the Internet, HTTP, and Servers.</em> When <b>you</b> go on a web <b>browser</b>
  (such as Chrome or Firefox), you connect to the <b>Internet</b> which
  connects to an <b>HTTP</b> (main protocol of the web) which then connects
  to a <b>Server</b>. The <b>Server</b> responds back with the correct page of what 
  you searched for through <b>HTTP</b> which sends 
  it back to your <b>browser</b> for <b>you</b> to view.
</p>

 <h3>HTML</h3>
 <p>The worldwide web is made up of <em>HTML</em> documents. <em>HTML</em> stands for
   <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. It is the basis for everything on the web (what 
   glues everything together). <em>HTML</em> is made up of <b>text content</b> (what you
   see), <b>markup</b> (what it looks like/arranged), and <b>references to other documents</b>
   (eg. images, videos, links to other pages).
 </p>

 <p><em>HTML TAGS</em>: <b>b</b> tag (bold), <b>em</b> tag (emphasis in italic), <b>a</b> tag (anchor tag
   used for making links by creating attributes), <b>img</b> tag (images), <b>br</b> tag (line breaks), 
   and <b>p</b> tag (paragraphs). 

   <p>Tags are either <b>block</b> elements (start on a new line/invisible box
   around them) or <b>inline</b> elements (just end a line/no invisible box around them).
 </p>

 <p><b>Block</b> elements include - <em>p, div, form</em> <br> <b>Inline</b> elements
   include - <em>a, span, br, img, strong</em>
 </p> 

 <p>Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag (ex. <em>p</em> tag). Tags that don't require
   closing tags are called "void tags" (ex. <em>br tag)</em>.
 </p>

<h3>Main Points</h3>

<p><b>What is a web page?</b> <br>A web page is a text document written in language called <em>HTML</em>.
  Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>

<p><b>How coding works</b> <br>When programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand, the computer can then
  follow the instructions the programmer wrote. 
</p>

<p><b>Computers are stupid</b> <br>Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands
  (also known as writing the correct "syntax".
</p>

<p><b>Programmers Can't Remember Everything!</b></p>

<p><b>HTML tags</b> are always contained within angled brackets. <b>HTML elements</b> refer to everything within
a set of opening and closing tags. An <b>attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element (href attribute
  of anchor tag).
